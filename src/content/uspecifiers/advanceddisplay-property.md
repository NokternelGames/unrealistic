The `AdvancedDisplay` specifier hides the property from the details panel of the containing class by default. The details panel will then contain a toggleable arrow at the bottom of the relevant category that, when clicked, will show all `AdvancedDisplay` properties in that category.

This specifier is useful for hiding properties that are infrequently changed or that need to be changed only in advanced use cases.
