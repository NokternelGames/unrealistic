snippet: This property can be read by Blueprints, but not modified.
values: null

This property can be read in a Blueprint graph, but not modified. In Blueprint terms, this means you can call `Get` for the property, but there is no matching `Set` for the property.

This Specifier is mutually exclusive with the `BlueprintReadWrite` Specifier.
